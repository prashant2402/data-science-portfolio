# 👩‍💻 Data Science Portfolio – Prash

Welcome to my data science portfolio! Over the past year, I've transitioned from a background in **DevOps / MLOps / Software Engineering** into the **Data Science and Machine Learning** space — building projects that combine deep technical implementation with clear business storytelling.

This portfolio showcases a selection of end-to-end projects that reflect real-world problem-solving, collaboration with industry partners, and my ability to bridge data with impact.
