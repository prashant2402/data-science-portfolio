# ðŸš¢ Ship Engine Anomaly Detection â€“ Mini Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalous activity in ship engine performance using machine learning techniques. The goal is to flag irregular patterns that may indicate poor maintenance, potential malfunctions, or safety risks â€” all of which have implications for fuel efficiency and operational reliability in the shipping industry.

This mini-project was completed as part of the **Data Science Career Accelerator** delivered in partnership with the **University of Cambridge** and the **Bank of England**.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

A poorly maintained ship engine in the supply chain industry can cause:
- Increased fuel consumption
- Risk of breakdowns
- Safety hazards
- Higher operational costs

Your challenge: **Build a machine learning pipeline to detect anomalies in engine sensor readings.**

- `ship_engine_anomaly_detection.ipynb` â€“ Main storytelling notebook (exported as `.py` here)
- `data/` â€“ Engine performance dataset (simulated or anonymized real-world data)
- `reports/` â€“ final PDF report or summary
- `README.md` â€“ Youâ€™re here!

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Unsupervised learning
- Anomaly detection via **Isolation Forest**
- Data cleaning, normalization, visualization
- Evaluation through visualization and interpretation

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- Engine parameters were clustered around normal operational zones
- Isolation Forest helped highlight rare activity points
- The method was sensitive to feature scaling and input distributions
- Visualization of anomaly scores guided interpretation

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results Summary

The final model flagged several potentially anomalous readings that could signal:
- Sensor failures
- Irregular usage patterns
- Unscheduled maintenance needs

The results demonstrate how anomaly detection can support **preventive maintenance** strategies in maritime logistics.
